## MLflow with Pytorch

This folder contains three subdirectories: `MNIST`, which demonstrates MNIST handwritten digit recognition with mlflow autolog, `SentimentAnalysis`, which demonstrates how to use mlflow autolog functionality with a Bert Sentiment analysis classifier and `AX-BoTorch` which demostrates the hyper parameter optimization.
